# Superellipse_Ducts

These codes are Solidworks macros (Tested on SW 2018, 2021). Running them will create a lofted 3D model of a duct that transitions between a circular cross-section and a rectangular cross-section using a series of superellipse curves. The curves are defined such that the guide curves for the superellipse semi-axes are tangent to the duct axis (streamiwse) direction; and the transition between the areas of the ducts are the same as if a conical duct of same inlet/outlet areas was implemented. 

The "Straight" version of this macro simply implements a superellipse-based duct along a straight line. The "Curved" version will allow the user to draw a Spline curve on a sketch (the sketch must be active prior to running the macro). The Spline will guide the center of the superellipses, allowing to bend the duct in organic shapes. Note that curving this type of duct does not prevent flow separation, given the radial pressure gradients may become strong if the radius of curvature is small.
