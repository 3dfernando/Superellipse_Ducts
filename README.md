# Superellipse_Ducts

These codes are Solidworks macros (Tested on SW 2018, 2021). Running them will create a lofted 3D model of a duct that transitions between a circular cross-section and a rectangular cross-section using a series of superellipse curves. The curves are defined such that the guide curves for the superellipse semi-axes are tangent to the duct axis (streamiwse) direction; and the transition between the areas of the ducts are the same as if a conical duct of same inlet/outlet areas was implemented.
